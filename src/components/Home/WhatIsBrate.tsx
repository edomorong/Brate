          Brate Token is a next-generation utility token that powers the BRATE AI ecosystem â€” an advanced AI-based application designed to connect people, culture, and commerce. 
          More than a cryptocurrency, it's a gateway to a decentralized network where users can interact with AI avatars, make real-world payments, access geo-based experiences, and benefit from community-driven rewards. 
          Supporting NFT integrations and future-ready technology, Brate sets a new standard for digital engagement and real-world utility.
